# Microcar
Project for a tiny remote-control car, driven using linear actuators via a magnet, using phone as steering wheel.  Really just having fun with some simple electronics, a 3D printer and ChatGPT to do most of the coding.  

Here is the project with its driving surface removed, to show how it all works -- two miniature linear actuators drive a puck in x and y via the steel rails, and the magnet on the puck drags the tiny car around with it:
